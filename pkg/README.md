# Packaging
This directory contains packaging files for various distros/systems.

If you are a maintainer, please host a copy of the build scripts in here as well.
For example, Debian scripts would go in `debian/`, Void would have `void/` and so on. Also, don't forget to modify the `.gitignore` if needed.

**NOTE**: `arch/`, its `PKGBUILD` and associated files are maintained privately. Please do not submit PRs to this folder.
